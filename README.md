# The Price is Right! *Amazon Rendition*


## Summary of Virtual TPIR:
"The Price is Right" TV show is a timeless, unbelivably successful classic TV gameshow.  One that many of us have watched growing up that many are familiar with its cheesy but nostalgic theme and format.  As many have had the deep desire to be on this show, but don't have the guts to have their mugshot on display on national television, here is a chance to join in on the fun price guessing game!  Except, in this version you won't actually win anything besides a cute, little: "You Won!" HTML pop-up display message. (Which may or may not be an indictor that you spend way too much time on Amazon.com)  

The other differences between this virtual version and the Bob Barker classic is all of these products will be **actual** products currently listed from Amazon.com!  If you're like me, when you look on Amazon, you're scouring it for the cheapest version of what ever you're searching for, AS well as consumer ratings, Prime or Not Prime, product weight, etc, etc!  So, this version we're stepping it up a notch by adding a few more value sets from the product, therefore increasing game play options as well as complexity!


## Rules and Game Play

### 1. Entry into game: You vs. Computer 
The very first portion of the game acts just like classic TPIR where you are essentially a member of the audience.  A product is listed and you must guess the price of it, closer than what the computer will guess.  Once you've beat the computer, you advance to the next round. 

### 2. Main Game Play: You vs. Computer again
If you've advanced past the first round, now you'll get to play 3 seperate rounds against the computer once again except each round will represent a product from a different category of items.  (i.e. household items, tools & car parts, etc.)  This time you will guess in mulitple value sets that the item has along with the price to determine your score.  Such as product review stars,  The closer you get to the actual true value, the higher your score is.  

### 3. Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!
If you've out guessed the computer in all three rounds, and your score is subsequently higher than the computer YOU WIN!  

### 4. Optional (stretch goal) rapid fire round.
If you've made it passed both main rounds by beating the computer, a final, rapid fire 10 round game against the computer with a very short 3 second timer, with only guessing the price.
